This public repository contains the data and code used in the development of the concrete crack detection and measurement methods presented in the journal article entitled "Deep Learning for Concrete Crack Detection and Measurement". The datasets used to train the developed deep learning models are described in detail in the article. Summarised briefly, the datasets comprised of images of high variability from a new dataset NYA-Crack-DATA [1] combinied with images from exisiting datasets SDNET2018 [2] and Concrete Images for Classification [3].
